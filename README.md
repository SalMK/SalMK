- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Salman Mohd Khan ( @SalMK ), Post Doctoral Fellow at Centre of Cognitive and Brain Sciences, IIT Gandhinagar.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Bioemdical Signal Processing and Machine Leanring...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Neural Networking. Previosuly, I have worked on machine learning. It includes simpler algorithms such as Decision Tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Multi-layer Perceptron. I have also worked on complex and ensemble classifiers such as Random Forest CLassifiers, Gradient Boosting Classifiers and Adaptive Boosting Classifiers...
- Iâ€™m currently working on Electroencephalography Signal Processing. I have an expertise of working on Pattern Recognition based Control Schemes using Electromyogaphy Signals. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Biomedical Signal Processing. Feel free to contact on salmanmkhan225@gmail.com...
